        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This ingredient isn’t incredibly popular in North America, but it
            should be! They’re quite literally just cattle tails cut into small
            pieces. You’ll typically see oxtails braised low and slow. With this
            cooking preparation, they become incredibly tender, very similar to
            short ribs.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sear the oxtails:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large
                braiser or dutch
                oven over medium-high heat. Season the oxtails with salt and
                pepper, and sear them on all sides until browned. You may need
                to do this in batches. Transfer the oxtails to a plate and set
                the oxtails aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté:</strong> Add the onion to the pot and cook until
                translucent and
                softened, 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and habanero, then
                stir and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the allspice, smoked
                paprika, soy sauce, tomato paste, and cook for 2-3 minutes until
                the paste browns slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Braise:</strong> Add the oxtails back to the pot. Stir
                in the beef broth,
                thyme, bay leaves and bring the pot to a boil. Turn the heat to
                low and cover with a lid slightly cracked. Simmer for 2 hours,
                remove the lid and stir in the butter beans, then simmer for
                another 30-45 minutes uncovered.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Whisk the
                cornstarch with 1 tbsp water to create a slurry. Stir the slurry
                into the pot and increase the heat to medium, stirring until the
                mixture thickens. Garnish with freshly chopped green onion.</li>
