            Tuesday became a thing? These are those very tacos, only better, and
            theyâ€™ll bring back all those flavorful memories.</p>

            <li>lime</li>
            <li>baking soda</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
            <li>taco shells</li>
            <li>oregano</li>
            <li>cayenne</li>
            <li>coriander</li>
            <li>chili powder</li>
            <li>ground beef</li>
            <li>avocado</li>
            <li>tomatoes</li>
            <li>shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>cheese</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mash the beef with the baking soda and salt.
                Let sit for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour. This process
                raises the pH level of the beef, making it more alkaline and
                resulting in a more tender texture.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot and shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Do not brown.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and spices.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring constantly and breaking meat up with a wooden spoon, until the beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, water, sugar, and lime juice.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring frequently and breaking up the meat so that no chunks remain, until the liquid has reduced and thickened (the mixture should not be completely dry), 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the filling evenly among taco shells; place two or three tacos on individual plates. Serve immediately, passing the toppings separately.
