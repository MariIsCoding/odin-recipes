        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a brine using a combination of cold water, corn syrup,
                salt, and white vinegar.
                Slice the potatoes into strings just under 1/2 inch thick. Drop
                into the brine.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or as long as overnight.
                Drain, rise twice with cold water, then pat them completely dry.</li>
            <li>Fry in batches at 300°F for about 5 minutes. Remove and set
                aside on a paper towel.
                They will be very soft. (This is a good thing.)</li>
            <li>Add vegetable shortening to the oil. Increase heat to 400°F and
                fry again until the fries are crisp and golden brown. Remove and
                let drain on paper towels.
                Season immediately with salt and serve!</li>
